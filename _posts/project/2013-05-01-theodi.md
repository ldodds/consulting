ODI Associate

Since May 2013 I have been working part-time with the [Open Data Institute](http://theodi.org) as an Associate of the technical team.

Whilst working with the ODI I've undertaken a number of projects including:

* Designing the [Open Data Rights Statement Vocabulary](http://schema.theodi.org/odrs/) and the supporting [publisher](http://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-open-data-licensing) and [re-users](http://theodi.org/guides/odrs-reusers-guide) guides to support machine-readable publication of licensing information
* Exploring ways to [attribute and cite open data](http://hat-tip.herokuapp.com/)
* Developing a library for working with [Data Packages](https://github.com/theodi/datapackage.rb)
* Working with the technical team on the design and implementation of the [CSVlint](http://csvlint.io) validation service
* A project in collaboration with the Office of National Statistics to explore [publication of open statistical data](http://theodi.org/blog/publishing-open-statistical-data)
