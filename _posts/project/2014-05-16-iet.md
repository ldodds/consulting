Exploration of the benefits of domain-driven product design

I undertook a short project with the [IET](http://www.theiet.org/) to explore the benefits of domain-modelling in the creation of data-driven products

The project involved:

* Designing and running a training workshop with technical, editorial and management staff to introduce domain modelling as an approach to product development
* Analysis of internal assets to examine data curation processes and data models to provide a framework for developing a domain model for some key resources
* Providing input into architectural strategy for creating data-driven products
