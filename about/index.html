	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>I'm a skilled software engineer, architect, and product manager with experience in building data driven products. I’ve got many years of experience working in a variety of roles using a range of technologies. I’ve built R&D prototypes, been involved in hands-on design and implementation of a number of data-driven products, lead large engineering teams, and have been the product manager for a SaaS data platform business. I’ve trained and mentored other engineers on new technologies and like working in teams where I get to learn new skills too.</p>
	<p>My consulting company offers me the ability to work on exciting projects with a number of interesting organisations. Whether you need help for a few weeks or over a longer period, I’d be interested in talking.</p>
	<p>Over the last few years my focus has been on exploring ways to build data-driven products and approaches for putting data on the web. If you’re working on an Open or Linked Data project, or need help in designing a good API for your developer community, then I’d love to talk to you.
